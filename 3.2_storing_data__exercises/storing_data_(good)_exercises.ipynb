One condition is applied then, another condition is applied within those conditons. [\\:3][0] will yield index 0 of shortened range from 0 to 2. <br> Meanwhile for arrays, the conditions are applied in a more \"independent?\" way. [:3,0] will yield position 0 from all 2d values from range index 0 to 2. Like there are 2 different types of conditions being applied, one of the range of the 2d values then one within those 2d \"lists within a lists\"\n",
